### Introduction
<br>
GPS measures the time phase difference of signals travelled from satellite to receiver instrument and computes the distance using simple relationship "distance = velocity*time" and then determines the coordinates using empheris of the satellites.<br>
This experiment is useful to study of measurements using GPS.<br>

### Principle
<br>
GPS measures the time phase difference of signals travelled from satellite to receiver instrument and computes the distance using simple relationship "distance = velocity*time" and thendetermines the coordinates using empheris of the satellites.<br><br>

### Equipments Used <br>

 1) Receiver<br>
 2) Controller (display and commands)<br>
 3) Battery for power supply<br>
 4) Tripod or stand<br><br>

### Dos and Don'ts<br>

#### Dos<br>

1) Always calibrate the GPS receiver to a known benchmark.<br>
2) Always take the observations when more than four satellites are tracked as it will give a better intersection.<br>
3) Spend more than 5 minutes for observation on each point in order to have better mean value.<br>
4) Use DGPS technique if higher accuracy of observation is desired.<br>

#### Don'ts<br>

1) Never take single observation of a point from GPS, as it may give incorrect reading.<br>
2) Never keep the GPS instrument surrounded by high rise buildings, forest area etc., as these surrounding features will block the signals from satellites.<br>
